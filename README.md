# neatnotes

neatnotes is a notes-taking Android mobile application that aims to allow users to easily create and manage their notes on the go. It has a simplistic yet functional interface, making it easy
for anyone to use.

For the front-end, it is built using Flutter. For the backend, neatnotes utilises Firebase authentication to ensure that users would not be able to see each other's notes, as well as Firestore to store notes data.

This is an application that I built when I first picked up Flutter, and it is adapted from the tutorial provided by [Vandad Nahavandipoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPvVD8t02U8). If you are interested in learning Flutter, I would highly recommend Vandad's course, which not only provides a good introduction of Dart and Flutter, but also the intricacies of software development.

## APK Download
